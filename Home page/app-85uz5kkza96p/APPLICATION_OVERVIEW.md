- **No login required**: Use immediately without accounts

## 💡 Quick Tips

### For Best Results
✅ Use 100-10,000 data points  
✅ Ensure coordinates are in decimal degrees  
✅ Include numeric values for all fields  
✅ Keep files under 10MB  

### Common Data Formats
**Latitude**: -90 to 90 (negative = South, positive = North)  
**Longitude**: -180 to 180 (negative = West, positive = East)  
**Values**: Any numeric measurements
